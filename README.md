# My Portfolio :star:
While I was passing the web development school courses and the challenges that I was proposing myself, I decided to create a place where I could show my projects. As a result I have this page in GitHub Pages that allows me to constantly update it with the skills, services I am able to offer and the new things I am learning in this long road of web development.

## View Portfolio :rocket:
[Deploy](https://christbm.github.io/portfolio/)

## Design Techniques :black_nib:
I wanted to use some UI/UX design trends:

* Responsive Design & Mobile First
* Neumorphism
* Performance and Accessibility
* Simplicity and cleanliness

Adding my particular touch I started to give it the aesthetics that I thought was appropriate to build my portfolio.

Therefore this page is optimized for different devices. It uses a modern and simplified aesthetic. It has a pretty high score in Chrome DevsTools Lighthouse.

## Improvement tasks :white_check_mark:
According to the advice of people who have visited it, they recommend it to me:

* [x] Sticky Menu
* [x] Text improvements
* [x] Card Spacing
* [ ] Night Mode
* [x] Social Networking
* [x] goToUp Arrow
* [x] Transitions or Animations
* [x] Favicon
* [x] Update links to jobs
* [ ] Select Languages(ES/EN)

## Future :stars:
I'm interested in adding new things to the portfolio, both visually and in the code without breaking the initial aesthetics.

1. Update my networks and the links to them.
2. Add a link in the menu to another web page or web application I plan to build to show other things I know how to do.
3. Keep adding jobs in the Works section, skills in the Skills section and the Services I am more used to do.
4. Maybe in the not too distant future I will build it with React and have a domain of my own.****
